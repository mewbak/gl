# gl
This package provides Go idiomatic types to represent OpenGL native types and associates OpenGL function to the proper Go type. The goal is to prevent errors from being made by using the type safety or the compiler without affecting performance. This package SHOULD be compiled with quadruple -l flag for optimisation.
